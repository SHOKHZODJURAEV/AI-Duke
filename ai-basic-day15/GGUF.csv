**What is GGUF**
The full name of the GGUF format is *GPT-Generated Unified Format*.
When talking about GGUF, its predecessor **GGML** (*GPT-Generated Model Language*)
must be mentioned. GGML is a tensor library specifically designed for machine learning, 
first introduced in October 2022. Its goal was to provide a single-file sharable format
that is easy to use for inference across different GPU and CPU architectures. However, 
during subsequent development, issues such as lack of flexibility, compatibility problems, 
and difficulties in maintenance were encountered.
