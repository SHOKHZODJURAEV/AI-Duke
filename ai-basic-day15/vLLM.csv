vLLM is an **open-source library for efficient LLM (Large Language Model) inference and serving**. Itâ€™s designed to make running and deploying large models faster, cheaper, and easier.

Hereâ€™s what itâ€™s mainly used for:

1. **Efficient LLM Inference** â€“ It optimizes how models process requests so they can generate text faster and use less memory.
2. **Continuous Batching** â€“ Unlike traditional serving, vLLM can dynamically batch incoming requests of different lengths together, greatly improving throughput.
3. **PagedAttention** â€“ Its core innovation: a memory-efficient attention mechanism that avoids wasting GPU memory, allowing bigger models to run on smaller GPUs.
4. **Model Serving** â€“ It can serve models (like LLaMA, GPT, Falcon, MPT, etc.) through APIs, making it easier to integrate into applications.
5. **Compatibility** â€“ Works with Hugging Face models and integrates with tools like **OpenAI API format**, **LangChain**, and **Ray**.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **vLLM is used to run large language models efficiently in production, with higher throughput, lower latency, and better GPU memory usage compared to standard frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers.**
