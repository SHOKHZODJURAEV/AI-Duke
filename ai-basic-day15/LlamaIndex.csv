**LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index)** is an **AI data framework** that helps you connect **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT, LLaMA, or other open-source models to your **own data sources**.

Here‚Äôs what it‚Äôs used for:

* **Data Ingestion & Indexing**
  It lets you load data from many sources (databases, APIs, PDFs, Notion, Slack, documents, etc.) and structure it into indices that an LLM can efficiently query.

* **Context Management**
  Instead of dumping huge amounts of text into a model, LlamaIndex organizes information into chunks, summaries, and embeddings so the model can retrieve just what it needs for a response.

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  LlamaIndex powers RAG pipelines‚Äîmeaning you can ask questions in natural language, and the framework retrieves the most relevant context from your data before passing it to the LLM.

* **Integration & Tools**
  It provides APIs to integrate LLMs with external tools (SQL databases, vector stores, knowledge graphs), making applications like chatbots, Q\&A assistants, or research agents much easier to build.

* **Use Cases**

  * Build **chatbots** over your company‚Äôs internal docs.
  * Create **knowledge assistants** for customer support.
  * Enable **semantic search** across unstructured data.
  * Power **workflow automation** where LLMs need structured context.

üëâ In short: **LlamaIndex is a ‚Äúmiddleware‚Äù layer that connects your data with LLMs so they can understand, retrieve, and reason over it efficiently.**


The most commonly used CUDA versions are 11.8 and 12.1.

For CNN models in PyTorch/TensorFlow, the supported computation methods are different.

Problem:
The inference platform of the model and the model‚Äôs format can both have some impact on the model‚Äôs performance (normally very small). The reason is that a model is essentially a matrix (a collection of parameters). The calculation precision and computation methods depend on the inference platform and the way the model parameters are stored.

Once a model crosses platforms, its precision will undergo some changes.
