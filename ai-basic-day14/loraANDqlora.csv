LoRA and QLoRA

LoRA: LoRA is a technique for fine-tuning large language models. It uses a low-rank approximation method to adapt models with billions of parameters (such as GPT-3) to specific tasks or domains.

QLoRA: QLoRA is an efficient fine-tuning method for large language models that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the performance of full 16-bit fine-tuning. It achieves this by backpropagating gradients into low-rank adapters within a fixed, 4-bit quantized pre-trained language model.

Hereâ€™s the practical breakdown of LoRA vs QLoRA in simple ML terms:

1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Main idea: Instead of updating all billions of parameters in a large model, insert small trainable adapter layers that capture the necessary changes.

Why: Saves memory and computation because youâ€™re only training a tiny fraction of the model.

Memory usage: Lower than full fine-tuning, but still stores weights in full precision (e.g., 16-bit or 32-bit).

When to use: When you have enough GPU memory but still want a more efficient fine-tuning than retraining the whole model.

2. QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)
Main idea: Take LoRA and make it even more memory-efficient by first quantizing (compressing) the base model to 4-bit precision, then applying LoRA adapters.

Why: Large language models can be hugeâ€”quantization makes them much smaller and reduces GPU RAM requirements while keeping performance almost identical.

Memory usage: Far less than LoRAâ€”can fine-tune 65B+ parameter models on a single high-end GPU.

When to use: When you have limited GPU memory but still want high-quality fine-tuning.

Key Differences
Feature	LoRA	QLoRA
Base model size	Full precision (16/32-bit)	4-bit quantized
GPU memory needed	Medium	Very low
Training speed	Faster than full fine-tuning, slower than QLoRA	Fastest
Performance drop	Minimal	Minimal if done right
Best use case	Good GPU budget	Tight GPU budget

ðŸ’¡ In short:

LoRA = Smaller training footprint, keeps base model in normal precision.

QLoRA = Even smaller footprint by compressing base model to 4-bit, making it possible to fine-tune very large models on modest hardware.
